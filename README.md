# Disease-Identification

Use Deep Learning Methods to analyze gene based microarray data to make classifcations on diseases, especially cancers, where the model is going to identify cancer stages for different cancers.


Methodologies:
- Multilayer Perceptron in architecture 
- Bayesian Statistics in uncertainty 
- Self-Organizing Mapping in dimensionality reduction
